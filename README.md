# MineOS

MineOS helps you host and manage your Minecraft servers! MineOS is small and takes just a couple minutes to get up and running.

## Features

* Full user-management system using /etc/shadow passwords

* Self-contained, script-installable package with python-based webserver Cherrypy

* Web user interface with modern Knockout templating

* Full-featured CLI

## Getting Started

Installation instructions can be found at [the MineOS wiki](http://mineos.codeemo.com/mineoswiki/index.php?title=Installing_MineOS), or you can watch [this YouTube tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idEAnpa4yUQ&feature=share&list=UUTdhIeaydDUDLCDSN7PEBaQ).

## Compatibility

MineOS should support most modern Unices. MineOS does not support Windows natively, but why would you do that to yourself?
